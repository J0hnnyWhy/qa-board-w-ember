Description: This app allows a user to add a question with an author, select a question and input an answer. The user can delete questions and answers from the question page. Be sure to use the carousel on the about page.


Because the app uses AJAX to load templates, you cannot open `index.html` from the `file://` protocol. Instead, you must start a web server to load your app. The easiest way to start a web server is to download [Mongoose](http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml), copy it into your project directory, and open it up. Alternatively, on a Mac, you can run `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from your project directly, and then in your browser, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000.
